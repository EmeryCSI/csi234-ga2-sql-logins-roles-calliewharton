1. The SELECT permission allows a user to view different tables within a database. INSERT allows users to create new records within the table, like adding a new employee or product. The UPDATE permission lets users change the data in an existing record. The DELETE command allows users to remove a record from the database.
2. Schema-level permissions apply across an entire database, while table-level ones are only in effect when dealing with a given table. 
3. Column-level permissions are even more restrictive than table-level ones. The ITSupportUser only being allowed to update certain columns, but being blocked from updating salary, is one example of a column-level permission; the same goes for the SalesRepUser being blocked from viewing the Salary column.
4. The principle of least privilege is the idea that someone should only be given the minimum permissions needed. This prevents lower-level or lower-clearance employees accessing, changing, deleting, or adding records they should not have access to. In this setup, the SalesRepUser is unable to see the salary column or update any data. The ITSupportUser can update some columns, but not all, and can't add or delete records. The HRManagerUser is able to do all of these things, given that this is the most senior role in the company. 
5. A potential security benefit of using specific roles for assigning access is that it applies the same permissions to everyone with that role. That way, there is less room for error and fewer opportunities for someone to be able to do something they shouldn't. Also, having specific passwords for each login ensures that only people who are authorized can even connect to the database in the first place. This adds another layer of security and makes it more difficult for someone to see more than they're supposed to be able to.
